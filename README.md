# NBA-Overview-Dashboard
This repository contains files associated with the "NBA-Overview-Dashboard" project worked on by Ben Huston. This project was made to demonstrate some of my Tableau, MySQL, and Excel skills.
The purpose of this project was to create a Tableau dashboard that would help a casual basketball fan become more deeply immersed in the sport. I decided to make this project when I spent the entirety of an NBA game explaining to my friend who's who on the court and which team they should become a fan of moving forward. I thought this would be a fun solution that could educate those it concerns as to the leaders in different statistics, which teams found success recently (in the 2021 NBA season), and who my friend should root for moving forward (based on which teams have an exciting playstyle and are near us geographically). 
 To perform this project, I downloaded csv files from https://www.basketball-reference.com/. I then performed preprocessing (including cleaning and EDA) on these files using SQL and excel. I finished this process by connecting a tableau dashboard to this MYSQL database, and creating a dashboard to serve the overarching purpose of this project.
